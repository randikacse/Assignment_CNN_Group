Assignment: Classifying Images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
In this assignment you will work with a dataset, which consists of images of plants
available on Kaggle. You are required to develop a classifier that can take an image
of a plant as input and predict the type (species) of plant. You need to train and
evaluate your models using 5-fold cross validation of the training data available at
the aforementioned link. Complete the following steps, while optimizing your model
in each case to get the best possible accuracy.
